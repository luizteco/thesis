Project notes — how to add product images and display STLs

1) Where to put assets
- Product cover images: add an image file under `public/preview-images/` and reference it in `public/devices.toml` as `previewImagePath` (e.g. `/preview-images/cutlery.png`).
- Product display STL: add a small preview `.stl` file under `public/preview-models/` and set `previewStlPath` in `public/devices.toml` (e.g. `/preview-models/cutlery-display.stl`).

2) How to update devices
- Edit `public/devices.toml` and update the `[[device]]` block for the product. Use `previewImagePath` and `previewStlPath` fields to point to your files.
- Only the following products are supported in the UI: `cutlery`, `cup`, `button`, `bidet`.

3) Per-product UI rules (already implemented)
- `bidet`: no customization inputs — only title, information and download are shown.
- `button`: shows **Width** and **Height** inputs (no depth/thickness input required).
- `cup`: shows **Height** and **Thickness** inputs (no width input required).
- `cutlery`: shows **Height** and **Thickness** inputs and an "Include handle" checkbox (no width input required).

4) Testing locally
- Start the dev server: `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5174`.
- Verify the Devices page shows only the four products and that each product page shows the correct inputs and preview.

5) Uploading to production
- When deploying, upload your preview images and display STLs to the production `public` folder or your hosting bucket (Cloudflare R2). Update `previewImagePath` and `previewStlPath` to point to the production URLs if using R2.

CI Automation (GitHub Actions)
- This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/upload-assets-to-r2.yml` that uploads `public/preview-images/*` and `public/preview-models/*` to your Cloudflare R2 bucket on push to `main`.
- To enable it, add the following secrets in your repository settings:
	- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` — your Cloudflare account id
	- `CF_API_TOKEN` — an API token with `Account > R2 Storage: Read` and `Write` permissions for your account
	- `R2_BUCKET_NAME` — the R2 bucket name where assets should be uploaded

After the workflow runs, the files will be available under your R2 bucket; the workflow does not edit `public/devices.toml` for you, so ensure `previewImagePath` and `previewStlPath` point to the final public URLs (e.g., `https://pub-<yourid>.r2.dev/preview-images/cutlery.png`).

If you want, I can: (a) remove the unused placeholder image `public/preview-images/adaptive-handle.png`, or (b) add an admin script to validate that `previewStlPath` files exist and warn about missing preview models.
